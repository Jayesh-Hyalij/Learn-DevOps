### üîó How They Work Together
```
1. Docker is the foundation (build/run containers)
2. Compose is for local orchestration (multiple services on one host)
3. Swarm is for distributed deployment and scaling (multi-node)
```

**You typically:**
- Build/test with Docker + Compose
- Deploy to Swarm using the same docker-compose.yml or stack.yml

### üìà Real-World Workflow
**1. Write a Dockerfile for your app**

**2. Create docker-compose.yml to define services (app, DB, cache, etc.)**

**3. Test locally using:**
```
bash
docker compose up
```
**4. Push images to Docker registry (Hub or private)**

**5. Deploy to production with Swarm:**
```
bash
docker swarm init
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml prodstack
```
